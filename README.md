A Small Next.js Project I created to learn Next.Js

## Description

This project was created as a way to learn and explore Next.js, a popular framework for building React applications. It serves as a simple starting point for beginners who want to get hands-on experience with Next.js.

The project includes basic setup and a sample page with routing and styling.
